# Star Wars API
This project is designed to render data from https://swapi.dev/
It is developed on React js technology.
Here I actively use the sass and bootstrap library for styling, which will allow you to immerse yourself in the world of Star Wars with maximum realism.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`
 
Runs The World of Star Wars in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In this application you will be able to explore all heroes, all planets and all spaceships from all universes and their characteristics.
